// ### Fill Out the API Routes to Perform RESTful CRUD Operations

// Fill out the unfinished routes in `product-routes.js`, `tag-routes.js`, and `category-routes.js` to perform create, read, update, and delete operations using your Sequelize models.

// Note that the functionality for creating the many-to-many relationship for products has already been completed for you.

// > **Hint**: Be sure to look at the mini-project code for syntax help and use your model's column definitions to figure out what `req.body` will be for POST and PUT routes!
